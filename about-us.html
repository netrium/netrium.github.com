        <h3>About the Contributors</h3>
We are a small team of soft­ware developers with extens­ive exper­i­ence of sys­tems imple­ment­a­tion across the trade life­cycle in the energy and cap­ital mar­kets. We believe that com­mer­cially avail­able soft­ware pack­ages that require “con­fig­ur­a­tion” badly com­prom­ise the oper­a­tional cap­ab­il­ity and asso­ci­ated cost base of many com­pan­ies that exper­i­ence rapid busi­ness growth. In par­tic­u­lar such sys­tems are not best suited to the oppor­tun­ity of trad­ing exotic con­tracts. We think it’s pos­sible to do much more with soft­ware innov­a­tion to improve new product devel­op­ment across the industry and thereby increase mar­ket liquidity. <br/><br/>We cre­ated Net­rium as we were tired of see­ing things being approached in the same old way, with incum­bent vendors not inter­ested in address­ing fun­da­mental prob­lems with poor soft­ware architecture.
<br/><br/>
At Net­rium we believe:<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>Open com­munit­ies with shared prob­lems can solve their own prob­lems effectively.</li>
<li>People are the most import­ant thing in driv­ing innov­a­tion, not a estab­lished soft­ware product</li>
</ol>
